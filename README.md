# Cedalion
RustBin is a pastebin clone written in Rust using [rotor-http](https://github.com/tailhook/rotor-http), [chomp](https://github.com/m4rw3r/chomp), and [diesel](https://github.com/sgrif/diesel).

The webpages use [Erato](https://github.com/nokaa/erato), a minimalistic stylesheet.

### TODO
